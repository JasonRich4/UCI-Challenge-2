        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="aboutme">My name is Jason Rich and I am an aspiring full-stack web developer. I'm new to the field of coding but I am confident in my ability to learn and execute new concepts. Predominantly I am a music producer, and have been one for over 10 years now. I picked up FL Studio in the summer of 2009 and have been learning it over the years. Since then, I have garnered a fanbase of over 40,000 followers and worked with some of my favorite artists in the rap scene. For example: Juicy J, Young Dolph, Lil Peep, bbno$, and Yung Gravy who I work the closest with.  <br> 
                I know there's not much room for me to translate my music experience into coding but I'm anticipating at some point that the minor technical experience I've gained in FL Studio could translate over in some way or another.</p>
